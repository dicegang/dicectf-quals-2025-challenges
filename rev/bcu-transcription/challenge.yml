  Comrades at the Institute for BioSafety have developed a prototype BCU-8 chip.
  They were able to get a simple `diffusion` experiment running successfully, but they're having trouble successfully running the `transcription` experiment.
  We keep getting the result "bad", can you figure out proper parameters?
