  Introducing `$BBL` - a _smooth_ revolution in cross-chain defi technology!

  Though we haven't gotten back our audit results yet, we believe in the future
  of Bubble so much that we've decided to shadow-launch it today!

  Grab your 10 free `$FTH`s from the airdrop (while supplies last), and remember
  to watch out for the wind...

  **Please do not deploy this challenge until you have a working solution locally.**
